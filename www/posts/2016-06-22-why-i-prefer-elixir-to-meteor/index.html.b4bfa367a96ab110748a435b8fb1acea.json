I’m a ‘code it, save it, check it’ kind of programmer, programming features bit by bit rather than all at once. Meteor rebuilds (on the server especially) take a really long time. On Elixir (with Webpack, in my case), it’s virtually instantaneous, meaning less time to get distracted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pattern matching has saved my bacon on more than one occasion already. Writing GraphQL queries which have different arguments with the premier GraphQL library (<a href=\"http://graphql-elixir.org/\">http://graphql-elixir.org/</a>) is a cinch. I’m sure I’ll just keep finding uses for that language feature.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More to come</strong></p>\n","__filename":"posts/2016-06-22-why-i-prefer-elixir-to-meteor.md","__url":"/posts/2016-06-22-why-i-prefer-elixir-to-meteor/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/2016-06-22-why-i-prefer-elixir-to-meteor/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/2016-06-22-why-i-prefer-elixir-to-meteor/index.html.b4bfa367a96ab110748a435b8fb1acea.json"}
